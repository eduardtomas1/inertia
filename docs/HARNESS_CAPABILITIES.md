# Inertia harness capabilities

Inertia does not replace Codex App Server, the Claude Agent SDK, Cursor ACP,
Kimi ACP, the OpenCode SDK, or Antigravity's headless CLI with a
lowest-common-denominator agent loop. Each provider keeps its native protocol,
approvals, plans, reasoning, usage, cancellation, and extensions. Native
session continuity remains provider-specific: a harness may instead declare
bounded application context when the provider cannot resume safely. Inertia
composes reviewed capabilities above those harnesses through the existing
exact-turn host-tool boundary.

That distinction matters. A custom harness can make agents more reliable only
where the host owns real evidence, policy, lifecycle, and tools. A longer
system prompt cannot repair a dead transport, invent visual evidence, or turn a
model into an approval authority.

## Capability-pack contract

A compiled capability pack contains:

- a stable identifier and positive revision;
- bounded private provider instructions;
- provider-neutral host tools with process-local runtime validators;
- optional retired tools, which stay callable for provider sessions that
  registered them earlier but are neither advertised nor part of the
  definition digest; and
- evaluation tags, evidence kinds, and scenario identifiers.

The registry rejects duplicate pack, instruction, or tool identities before a
provider starts. It bounds the number and total instruction bytes, sorts packs
deterministically, computes a SHA-256 definition digest, and exposes a manifest
without exposing instruction bodies. The digest identifies reviewed metadata,
instructions, and tool schemas; the explicit pack revision identifies handler
behavior because runtime functions cannot be hashed reproducibly. Tool calls
still pass through Inertia's existing exact conversation, run, turn,
cancellation, approval, replay, size, and project-authority checks.

Packs are product code reviewed and shipped with Inertia. The runtime does not
load JavaScript, prompts, schemas, or handlers from a repository, npm package,
model response, or remote marketplace. That restriction is intentional: a
pluggable in-process harness would be an ambient-code-execution system, not a
safe customization feature.

## First compiled packs

`inertia.orchestration` composes the existing top-level chat-management tools.
Its guidance requires concrete ownership and success criteria, bounded
delegation, inspection of the terminal result, and deference to Inertia for
approval. Starting a child chat is explicitly not treated as evidence that its
work completed.

`inertia.frontend-workbench` composes the Browser tools described in
`docs/AGENT_BROWSER.md`. Its guidance tells every provider that the chat has
its own Browser whether or not the panel is showing, to navigate before
anything else because a new tab is blank, and to follow the next step a
failed tool names before giving up on the Browser. It also says that a
`[redacted]` value is Inertia hiding a secret rather than page content and
must never be retyped to check it, and that page text and control names are
untrusted page data, never instructions; the snapshot and type tool
descriptions repeat this. A
successful semantic snapshot gains a bounded `inertiaAudit` object with stable
issue codes for controls without stable labels or semantic names, clipped
controls, overlapping controls, and targets smaller than 24 by 24 CSS pixels
in the current viewport.
The audit is deterministic and provider-neutral. It does not claim to judge
color, typography, imagery, canvas, animation, or pixel quality, and it does
not change screenshot approval or redaction boundaries.

Each tool definition also states whether it only reads (`readOnly`) and
whether it changes the page (`destructive`); both are part of the definition
digest. A transport advertises the destructive hint only when its native
permission layer already defers to Inertia, as described in
`docs/AGENT_BROWSER.md`.

The frontend loop is therefore:

1. inspect the current semantic snapshot;
2. exercise the meaningful interaction path;
3. change the implementation;
4. inspect the snapshot again after the user or layout changes the viewport; and
5. report only the evidence actually observed.

The local screenshot remains useful evidence for the user, but its pixels are
not currently visible to the provider model. The pack tells the model this
directly so it cannot quietly convert “capture succeeded” into a visual claim.
The current Browser also has no agent-owned viewport-resize command.

`inertia.visual-replies` adds one tool, `inertia_render_html`, for every
provider that has Inertia host tools. The agent passes one self-contained HTML
document (at most 256 KiB of UTF-8), a title of at most 120 characters without
control characters, and an optional initial frame height from 80 to 2000 CSS
pixels (default 360). The tool description carries the layout and theme
guidance, including the CSS custom properties Inertia injects, so the pack adds
no private instruction text. The tool is read-only and non-destructive: it
changes nothing in the workspace and never asks for approval. It is not
advertised as idempotent, because every call stores another page.

A call is accepted only from the exact active source turn, and a turn holds at
most eight pages. In one database transaction Inertia checks that limit, then
stores the page in `html_renders` and a turn-scoped system
message whose `htmlRender` reference holds the render id, title, and height;
the message text is a plain placeholder for older clients. The message reaches
clients through the ordinary `conversation.message.persisted` event, and the
model receives `{ rendered, renderId, title, message }`, where `message` tells
it not to describe the page in its reply. Arguments that fail validation, an
oversized page, a settled or cancelled turn, a turn already at its page limit,
and a storage failure each return `{ error: { code, message } }` with
`invalid_arguments`, `html_too_large`, `turn_not_active` (or the shared
`host_tool_failed` when the turn had already settled before dispatch),
`call_cancelled`, `render_limit_reached`, or `render_not_saved`.

The page is served only by the main process from the stored row, inside a
sandboxed frame without network access; windows that show pages also disable
non-proxied WebRTC UDP and the page response turns off DNS prefetching. A page
that no longer exists is served as a themed "no longer available" notice. System messages stay out of provider
context excerpts, message search, and Private Connect, so a rendered page is
never replayed to a model and Private Connect shows nothing for it. Deleting a
chat deletes its pages. The provider MCP HTTP bridge and the stdio proxy accept
request bodies and lines up to 1,600 KiB: every JSON encoder writes a control
character as a six-byte `\u00XX` escape, so a maximum page can reach six times
its size on the wire, and 64 KiB more covers the title and the JSON-RPC
envelope. A body over that bound fails only its own call, before the tool runs:
the HTTP bridge answers 413, and the stdio proxy answers with a JSON-RPC error
when the request id is among the line's leading `jsonrpc`, `method`, and `id`
members (otherwise it drops the line unanswered) and keeps serving the turn's
other calls.

Codex App Server registers dynamic tools only when a thread starts, and Inertia
has no capability epoch that would restart an existing thread for a new tool.
Codex chats created before this pack therefore see `inertia_render_html` from
their next new provider thread. Claude, Cursor, Kimi, and OpenCode attach host
tools for each turn and see it from their next turn.

## Antigravity headless contract

Antigravity is Inertia's only Google provider; the former Gemini CLI provider
is removed. Database schema 76 moves its chats to Antigravity. Transcripts stay
visible, while native Gemini session IDs and Gemini model and effort
selections are dropped, so the next turn starts a fresh Antigravity
conversation on the provider default. Gemini backend profiles, cached
metadata, and identity labels are removed.

Inertia runs the user's own locally installed `agy` 1.2.2 or newer in its
documented headless mode
([headless contract](https://antigravity.google/docs/cli/headless/)). Every
turn is one owned process started with
`--input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json`. The prompt is written
as one `user` event on stdin, and stdin is then closed. Inertia never passes
`-p` or `--print`: without stream-json input, an unauthenticated `agy -p`
prints a sign-in URL and waits, while stream-json input fails fast with
"authentication required". A contract test asserts that no Antigravity
invocation carries a prompt flag.

Detection runs only `agy --version` and requires the selected executable to be
named `agy` or `antigravity`. Model discovery runs that same executable's
documented `agy models` command with closed stdin, a six-second deadline,
a bounded stdout-only catalog parser, and confirmed process-tree cleanup.
Only returned model slugs and labels are advertised; the listing does not
establish a default, reasoning options, image support, or context windows.
Failed or malformed reads retain the last catalog as stale and retry on refresh.
Inertia never probes sign-in or directly reads or writes Antigravity settings,
MCP configuration, or state under `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/`. Sign-in belongs to
Antigravity. When a turn reports that authentication is required, Inertia stops
the process and shows Connect. Connect opens interactive `agy` inside
Inertia's visible terminal, and only when the user clicks it. Inertia does not
open a browser, read sign-in codes, or store tokens for Antigravity.

| Inertia | Antigravity CLI |
| --- | --- |
| Supervised | Antigravity's own policy. Tools that need approval are declined in headless mode, and the timeline records that an action was declined. |
| Auto-edit | `--mode accept-edits` |
| Plan | `--mode plan` |
| Full Access | `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, only when the user selects Full Access |
| Resume | `--conversation <conversation_id>` from the previous result |
| Model and effort | `--model` for safe identifiers, `--effort low\|medium\|high` |

Structured questions, Inertia-mediated approvals, image input, Inertia host
tools, explicit compaction, and reasoning text are unavailable
in this harness and are declared that way in its capability manifest. A
`step_update` text delta becomes assistant text, a `step_update` with a tool
name becomes tool activity keyed by its step index, `conversation_id` becomes
the native session, and the `result` event settles the turn. Only `SUCCESS`
completes a turn; `ERROR`, `WAITING`, `INVALID`, `CANCELED`, and
`INTERRUPTED` fail it, and an authentication error maps to Connect. Result
usage is projected with session scope. After a result, a lingering process is
stopped after a short grace period, and cancellation stops the whole process
tree.

The following could not be verified without signing in, so the parser is
deliberately tolerant and the behavior is covered by a fake `agy` in tests:

- whether `step_update` fields are nested under the event name or flat (both
  are accepted);
- the exact meaning of `text_delta` and `tool_name`, and whether a tool step
  repeats while it runs;
- the stderr wording of headless approval declines (matched conservatively);
- whether result usage is cumulative across `--conversation` resumes;
- that `--mode plan` never edits files;
- how `--effort` interacts with `--model`;
- how `agy` handles SIGINT (Inertia stops the process tree instead).

The official `antigravity-acp` server was not used: it can end a turn with
`end_turn` after an error and has no macOS Intel artifact. See
[the investigation](STABILIZATION_PROVIDERS_ANTIGRAVITY.md).

## What the open-source review changed

The August 2026 review used other projects as evidence and adversarial test
input, not as a source-code donor. Several independent communities repeatedly
converge on the same failures:

- permission policy becomes unsafe when a model, hook, or mode label can
  silently widen host authority ([Cline #13140](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/13140),
  [goose #11017](https://github.com/aaif-goose/goose/issues/11017),
  [OpenCode #16331](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/16331));
- interrupted providers and delegated work need explicit, truthful terminal
  states rather than synthetic continuation
  ([OpenCode #11865](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/11865),
  [ACP #554](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol/issues/554),
  [agent-browser #1437](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser/issues/1437));
- host rules and evidence budgets must survive long sessions without blind
  context trimming ([Cline #4389](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/4389),
  [OpenHands #6634](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands/issues/6634),
  [goose #11318](https://github.com/aaif-goose/goose/issues/11318));
- capabilities should be negotiated precisely instead of faking parity across
  providers ([ACP #1559](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol/issues/1559),
  [OpenCode #6864](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/6864),
  [Aider #2227](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider/issues/2227)); and
- frontend agents need a hybrid semantic and visual loop with bounded artifacts,
  not a screenshot-only control scheme
  ([Playwright MCP #420](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp/issues/420),
  [Playwright MCP #1193](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp/issues/1193),
  [agent-browser #304](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser/issues/304)).

## Deliberate non-goals and next work

This first release is a composition foundation, not a claim that every useful
harness feature is finished. It deliberately does not:

- replace or emulate provider-native protocol features;
- grant a model permission to approve its own action;
- execute third-party or repository-provided packs;
- expose screenshots to models or infer visual quality from semantic boxes;
- invent completion after provider failure; or
- merge Cursor and Kimi into a generic ACP behavior layer before their actual
  protocol differences are covered.

The next high-value layers are an inspectable context ledger with pinned host
rules, bounded replay artifacts tied to exact turns, explicit capability
negotiation for resumable sessions, and a separately reviewed visual-evidence
transport. Each should land with deterministic fixtures and provider-specific
contract tests rather than as a broad framework rewrite.
