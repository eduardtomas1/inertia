# Inertia harness capabilities

Inertia does not replace Codex App Server, the Claude Agent SDK, Cursor ACP,
Kimi ACP, or the OpenCode SDK with a lowest-common-denominator agent loop. Each
provider keeps its native session, protocol, approvals, plans, reasoning,
usage, cancellation, and extensions. Inertia composes reviewed capabilities
above those harnesses through the existing exact-turn host-tool boundary.

That distinction matters. A custom harness can make agents more reliable only
where the host owns real evidence, policy, lifecycle, and tools. A longer
system prompt cannot repair a dead transport, invent visual evidence, or turn a
model into an approval authority.

## Capability-pack contract

A compiled capability pack contains:

- a stable identifier and positive revision;
- bounded private provider instructions;
- provider-neutral host tools with process-local runtime validators; and
- evaluation tags, evidence kinds, and scenario identifiers.

The registry rejects duplicate pack, instruction, or tool identities before a
provider starts. It bounds the number and total instruction bytes, sorts packs
deterministically, computes a SHA-256 definition digest, and exposes a manifest
without exposing instruction bodies. The digest identifies reviewed metadata,
instructions, and tool schemas; the explicit pack revision identifies handler
behavior because runtime functions cannot be hashed reproducibly. Tool calls
still pass through Inertia's existing exact conversation, run, turn,
cancellation, approval, replay, size, and project-authority checks.

Packs are product code reviewed and shipped with Inertia. The runtime does not
load JavaScript, prompts, schemas, or handlers from a repository, npm package,
model response, or remote marketplace. That restriction is intentional: a
pluggable in-process harness would be an ambient-code-execution system, not a
safe customization feature.

## First compiled packs

`inertia.orchestration` composes the existing top-level chat-management tools.
Its guidance requires concrete ownership and success criteria, bounded
delegation, inspection of the terminal result, and deference to Inertia for
approval. Starting a child chat is explicitly not treated as evidence that its
work completed.

`inertia.frontend-workbench` composes the existing visible Browser tools. A
successful semantic snapshot gains a bounded `inertiaAudit` object with stable
issue codes for controls without stable labels or semantic names, clipped
controls, overlapping controls, and targets smaller than 24 by 24 CSS pixels
in the current viewport.
The audit is deterministic and provider-neutral. It does not claim to judge
color, typography, imagery, canvas, animation, or pixel quality, and it does
not change screenshot approval or redaction boundaries.

The frontend loop is therefore:

1. inspect the current semantic snapshot;
2. exercise the meaningful interaction path;
3. change the implementation;
4. inspect the snapshot again after the user or layout changes the viewport; and
5. report only the evidence actually observed.

The local screenshot remains useful evidence for the user, but its pixels are
not currently visible to the provider model. The pack tells the model this
directly so it cannot quietly convert “capture succeeded” into a visual claim.
The current Browser also has no agent-owned viewport-resize command.

## What the open-source review changed

The August 2026 review used other projects as evidence and adversarial test
input, not as a source-code donor. Several independent communities repeatedly
converge on the same failures:

- permission policy becomes unsafe when a model, hook, or mode label can
  silently widen host authority ([Cline #13140](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/13140),
  [goose #11017](https://github.com/aaif-goose/goose/issues/11017),
  [OpenCode #16331](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/16331));
- interrupted providers and delegated work need explicit, truthful terminal
  states rather than synthetic continuation
  ([OpenCode #11865](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/11865),
  [ACP #554](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol/issues/554),
  [agent-browser #1437](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser/issues/1437));
- host rules and evidence budgets must survive long sessions without blind
  context trimming ([Cline #4389](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/4389),
  [OpenHands #6634](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands/issues/6634),
  [goose #11318](https://github.com/aaif-goose/goose/issues/11318));
- capabilities should be negotiated precisely instead of faking parity across
  providers ([ACP #1559](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol/issues/1559),
  [OpenCode #6864](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/6864),
  [Aider #2227](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider/issues/2227)); and
- frontend agents need a hybrid semantic and visual loop with bounded artifacts,
  not a screenshot-only control scheme
  ([Playwright MCP #420](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp/issues/420),
  [Playwright MCP #1193](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp/issues/1193),
  [agent-browser #304](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser/issues/304)).

## Deliberate non-goals and next work

This first release is a composition foundation, not a claim that every useful
harness feature is finished. It deliberately does not:

- replace or emulate provider-native protocol features;
- grant a model permission to approve its own action;
- execute third-party or repository-provided packs;
- expose screenshots to models or infer visual quality from semantic boxes;
- invent completion after provider failure; or
- merge Cursor and Kimi into a generic ACP behavior layer before their actual
  protocol differences are covered.

The next high-value layers are an inspectable context ledger with pinned host
rules, bounded replay artifacts tied to exact turns, explicit capability
negotiation for resumable sessions, and a separately reviewed visual-evidence
transport. Each should land with deterministic fixtures and provider-specific
contract tests rather than as a broad framework rewrite.
